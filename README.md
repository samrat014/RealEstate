**Hey visitor**

Welcome to my repository where I showcase my Laravel API project for **Jay shree kali.**

Laravel is a PHP framework that provides a simple and elegant way to create web applications and APIs. It has many features that make development easier and faster, such as Eloquent ORM, Blade templating engine, authentication, validation, testing, and more.

In this project, I use Laravel to build a RESTful API that exposes some endpoints for managing users transaction keepking records. I follow the best practices of API design, such as using HTTP verbs, status codes, pagination, data wrapping, and conditional attributes. I also use Laravel's resource classes to transform my Eloquent models into JSON responses.

If you want to learn more about Laravel and how to build and test APIs with it, you can check out some of the resources I used:***

- Laravel API tutorial by Toptal: https://www.toptal.com/laravel/restful-laravel-api-tutorial
